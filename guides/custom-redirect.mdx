# What is a Custom Domain?

A Custom Domain is a domain name that you can use as a redirect_url for your custom bot. This allows you to use your own domain name instead of the RestoreCord domain name.

# Why is it important?

Discord is still able to link all RestoreCord bots together, even if you use a custom bot. This is because RestoreCord previously used the same domain name for all bots. This means that if you use a custom domain, you will be able to hide the fact that you are using RestoreCord.

<Note>
  Cloudflare is required to use custom domain. If you use something else, he
  highly suggest switching over to Cloudflare.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Adding Cloudflare">
    <Info>Create an account if required.</Info>
    > First, head over to Cloudflare Dashboard and add a new site

  </Step>


  <Step title="Set up Page Rules">
  <Warning>You can use a subdomain instead if your main domain is already in use. Such as: `verify.domain.com`</Warning>

    > Once you have **added** your domain name to Cloudflare, click on the **Page Rules** button in the **Sidebar**.

<Check>You have succesfully added your custom domain to RestoreCord.</Check>

## Troubleshooting

<Steps>
  <Step title="Domain already in use">
    > As mentioned above, if you **don't want** to use your main domain because you're **already using it** for a different service or website, then you may **replace** `domain.com` with something like `verify.domain.com`.
    >
    <Warning>Make sure to replace `domain.com` with `verify.domain.com` everywhere aswell</Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="This site can't be reached">
    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/custom-redirect_site-cant-be-reached.png"/>
    </Frame>
    > This usually happends if the domain you're currently using **does not have any DNS records on Cloudflare**.

    >  To solve this issue, **create a new `CNAME` record:** 
    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/cloudflare_cname.png"/>
